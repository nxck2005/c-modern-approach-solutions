# C Programming - A Modern Approach (2nd Edition) Solutions

Welcome to the repository containing my solutions to the exercises in "C Programming: A Modern Approach" (2nd Edition) by K. N. King. 
This book is an excellent resource for learning the C programming language, and this repository is aimed at helping fellow learners by providing solutions to all the exercises, rather than just even ones :)

## Issues

If you encounter any issues with the solutions or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue in the repository.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to K. N. King for writing an excellent book on C programming!
